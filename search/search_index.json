A suite of customized Drupal resource types and configurations that illustrate Islandora's capabilities are packaged as the Islandora Defaults module.</li> <li>Integrates with Fedora - Drupal resources can be stored in Lyrasis's Fedora Repository (version 5.0 or greater) as binaries (files) and RDF metadata.</li> <li>Uses microservices - Islandora provides an architecture for messaging and integration with any number of microservices, that provide services outside of the Drupal framework. Islandora's Crayfish suite of microservices provides functionality for synchronizing resources into Fedora and for automatically generating helper files, called derivatives.</li> <li> <p>Can handle messages at scale - Islandora created Alpaca, an integration middleware based on Apache Camel, to handle messaging and queueing at an enterprise scale. To the user, this means large batch uploads can be processed gracefully.</p> </li> <li> <p>Offers digital preservation features - Using a robust storage layer for preservation (Fedora), and generating technical metadata with FITS, are digital preservation tools provided by our automated installation methods. Community members have created additional features for doing digital preservation using Islandora, which are not yet part of our automated setup. </p> </li> <li>Exposes data to harvesters - Metadata about resources is available as linked data through the JSON-LD serialization module, and can be made available through Drupal, Fedora, or a triplestore. Islandora also offers a full configuration for exposing OAI-PMH so that metadata can be harvested by aggregators, and IIIF support means images in Islandora can be viewed in any IIIF-compliant viewer.</li> <li>Offers flexibility - As Islandora content is Drupal content, migrations and batch editing can be done through Drupal's built-in migrate framework and  vocabularies can be created using Drupal taxonomies. Contributed Drupal modules such as Solr Search API enable in-site search, and Matomo Analytics provides usage metrics for site analytics.</li> <li>Is a community - A dedicated, active community of users and developers is working to push new features, collaborate on improvements, design custom solutions, and create extended functionality. Some of these for Islandora 8 take the form of Recipes.</li> </ul>","location":"#this-is-islandora"},{"title":"Try Islandora","text":"","location":"#try-islandora"},{"title":"Online Sandbox","text":"<p>Try Islandora without installing anything at sandbox.islandora.ca.</p> <p>Login credentials for the sandbox can be found here.</p> <p>Anyone can log in to this sandbox as an administrator and explore the interface!

Whether you will eventually use CSVs or other sources (such as XML or directly from a Legacy Islandora) this tutorial should be useful as it covers the basics and mechanics of migration.</p> <p>This tutorial uses the configurations and code available in the migrate_islandora_csv module which, when enabled, will create three example migrations ready for you to use with the Migrate API. Each migration comes from one of the files in the <code>config/install</code> folder. We'll walk through them in detail below. The module is also uses Features which allows you to make changes to the configuration files and sync those changes into your Drupal site.</p>  <p>A note on using Features</p> <p>This tutorial (and Islandora in general) makes heavy use of Features, which is an easy way to ship and install Drupal configuration. However, after enabling a Feature module, the code in that module's directory is no longer \"live\", as the configuration now resides in the Drupal database. If you change code in the YAML files, it will not take effect until you re-import the Feature. There is a walkthrough in the \"Configuration\" section of the Migrate 7.x to Islandora tutorial.</p>  <p>Sample CSV and images are also included in the module as a convenience so they are easily available on the Drupal server running the migration. (This is not the recommended method for making files available to Drupal in a real migration.)</p> <p>The module also contains a Migrate process plugin that transforms strings into associative arrays. This is useful for populating multiple Linked Agent fields. (See \"Typed Relation\" for more information on the Linked Agent field.) It will be available when this module is enabled, and the node migration uses it. It was written generically and will hopefully become part of Migrate Plus, but for now it is here.</p> <p>When you are ready to create your actual migrations, the contents of this repository can function as a template for you to create the YAML files defining your own migrations.</p>","location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#summary"},{"title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Why CSV? CSV files (whether separated by commas, tabs, or other delimiters) are easy to understand and work with, and there's good tooling available for using them with Drupal's Migrate API. The Drupal contrib module migrate_source_csv provides a source plugin that reads from a CSV file, and migrate_plus provides more tools and flexibility for creating migrations, including the ability to create customized migrations using YAML and package them up as Features.</p> <p>In this tutorial, we'll be inspecting each migration file in detail before running it.  You'll start out by migrating the images themselves first, and then you'll create various Drupal entities to describe the files from the metadata in the CSV. It's not as scary as it sounds (especially since this module contains the data we'll be using in a <code>data</code> directory), but you will need a few things before beginning:</p> <ol> <li>An instance of Islandora. Use Islandora Playbook to spin up an environment pre-loaded with all the modules you need (except this one)</li> <li>Some basic command line skills.  You won't need to know much, but you'll have to <code>vagrant ssh</code> into the box, navigate into Drupal, and use <code>git</code> and <code>drush</code>, etc...  If you can copy/paste into a terminal, you'll survive.</li> </ol> <p>A big part of this tutorial relies on the islandora_defaults and controlled_access_terms_defaults features, which define the default metadata profile for Islandora (which we'll be migrating into). You're not required to use the <code>islandora_defaults</code> or <code>controlled_access_terms_defaults</code> for your repository, but for the purposes of demonstration, it saves you a lot of user interface administrivia so you can focus just on the learning how to migrate.  By the time you are done with this exercise, you'll be able to easily apply your knowledge to migrate using any custom metadata profile you can build using Drupal.</p>","location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#introduction"},{"title":"Overview","text":"<p>The Migrate API is the main way to ingest batches of data into Drupal (and because Islandora is Drupal, into Islandora). The Migrate module only provides the framework, it's up to you to create the rules that take data from a source, through a process (i.e. a mapping) to a destination. A set of these rules is called a \"migration\". It has to be set up (as a Configuration Entity, either by importing a YAML file or by installing a Feature) and then it has to be run.</p> <p>Once a migration has been run, it will have created (or updated) a bunch of Drupal entities of one type - whether that's taxonomy terms, nodes, files, etc. Since an Object in Islandora is made up of several different Drupal entities that refer to each other, it's going to take multiple migrations to create an Islandora object, and it's important to perform these migrations in a sensible order.</p> <p>A basic Islandora object is at minimum: - a file, which holds the actual binary contents of an item - a node, which holds the descriptive metadata for an item and makes it discoverable - a media, which holds technical metadata and references the file and the node, linking the two together.</p> <p>Therefore, each row in your CSV must contain enough information to create these.</p>  <p>Using multiple sources for object components</p> <p>While this tutorial uses a single CSV to describe all the parts of an islandora object, a site can use multiple sources (CSV or otherwise) to migrate the various parts. The only requirements then is to have keys in place matching the parts together. For example, a 'files.csv' can use paths that serve as file identifiers and 'metadata.csv' can use an object identifier. As long as the source for the media migration has the key values for the file and metadata migrations (the file paths and object identifiers, respectively, in this example), we can create the necessary links between the object's components. This is very useful when you need to migrate multiple media/file pairs  associated with a single node, such as pre-processed derivatives that need to be migrated.</p>  <p>Buried in your descriptive metadata are often references to other things which aren't repository items themselves, but records still need to be kept for them.  Authors, publishers, universities, places, etc... can be modeled as Drupal Entities, so that they can be referenced by other Entities.  So there's the potential to have a lot of different entity types described in a single row in a CSV.</p> <p>In this tutorial, we're working with <code>islandora_defaults</code> and <code>controlled_access_terms</code> entities, and will be migrating six entity types using the three migrations included in this module. - file - node - media - subject - person - corporate_body</p> <p>We can do this because subjects, persons, and corporate bodies are (in this example) represented by simple 'name' strings. We create them on the fly, as if we were adding new tags to a tag vocabulary. If we wanted to model subjects, people, or corporate bodies as entities with multiple fields (first name, last name, date, subheadings, URI, etc.) then we would need up to six migrations.</p> <p>Migrations follow the Extract-Transform-Load pattern.  You extract the information from a source, process the data to transform it into the format you need, and load it into the destination system (i.e. Drupal).  Migrations are stored in Drupal as configuration, which means they can be represented in YAML, transferred to and from different sites, and are compatible with Drupal's configuration synchronization tools. And the structure of each YAML file is arranged to follow the Extract-Transform-Load pattern.</p> <p>To perform the migrations, we'll be using <code>drush</code>. We will be able to run each of the file, node, and media migrations separately or all at once in a group. We will also learn how to roll back a migration in case it didn't go as planned.</p> <p>The sample migrations here will give us a chance to show off some techniques for working with multi-valued fields, entity reference fields, and complex field types like <code>controlled_access_terms</code>'s <code>typed_relation</code> field.  We'll also see how the migrate framework can help de-duplicate, and at the same time, linked data-ize :tm: your data by looking up previously migrated entities.</p> <p>So hold on to your hats.

But first, we have to know where a file is located and where it should be copied to.  We know where the file resides, we have that in the CSV's <code>file</code> column.  But we're going to have to do some string manipulation in order to generate the new location where we want the file copied.

Islandora uses <code>Flysystem</code>, which allows for integration with many different types of filesystems, both remote and local.  With <code>Flysystem</code>, the scheme part of the URI is the name of a filesystem.  By default, Fedora is exposed using the scheme <code>fedora://</code>.  So by setting uri to <code>fedora://csv_migration/Free Smells.jpg</code>, we're saying \"put Free Smells.jpg in the csv_migration directory in Fedora.\"</p> <p>Now, to perform this string manipulation in PHP, we'd do something like</p> <pre><code>$info = pathinfo($filepath);\n$filename = $info['basename'];\n$destination = \"fedora://csv_migration/\" . $filename;\n</code></pre> <p>We will mimic this exactly in the <code>process</code> section of our migration config.  Just like we declare variables and call functions with PHP code, we can make entries in the <code>process</code> section to store the output of Drupal process plugins. We'll build up a <code>destination</code> \"variable\" using a <code>filename</code> \"variable\" and pass it into the <code>file_copy</code> process plugin.</p> <p>To start, we'll get the filename using two process plugins, which do the same steps as the first two lines of the PHP above:</p> <pre><code>  filename:\n    -\n      plugin: callback\n      callable: pathinfo\n      source: file\n    -\n      plugin: extract\n      index:\n        - basename\n</code></pre> <p>The first process plugin, <code>callback</code>, lets you execute any PHP function that takes a single input and returns an output.  It's not as flexible as making your own custom process plugin, but it's still pretty useful in a lot of situations.  Here we're using it to call <code>pathinfo()</code>, telling it to use the <code>file</code> column in the CSV as input.  We pass the resulting array from <code>pathinfo()</code> to the <code>extract</code> process plugin, which pulls data out of arrays using the keys you provide it under <code>index</code>.</p> <p>Now that we have the file name, we have to prepend it with <code>fedora://csv_migration/</code> to make the destination URI.  In our PHP code above, we used <code>.</code> to concatenate the strings.  In the migration framework, we use the <code>concat</code> process plugin.  You provide it with two or more strings to concatenate, as well as a delimiter.</p> <pre><code>  destination:\n    plugin: concat\n    delimiter: /\n    source:\n      - constants/destination_dir\n      - '@filename'\n</code></pre> <p>In our PHP code, we concatenated the <code>$filename</code> variable with a string literal. In our process plugin, we can provide the variable, e.g. the output of the <code>filename</code> process step, by prefixing it with an <code>@</code>.  We can't, however, pass in <code>fedora://csv_migration</code> directly as a string.  At first glance, you might think something like this would work, but it totally doesn't:</p> <pre><code>  # Can't do this.  Won't work at all.\n  destination:\n    plugin: concat\n    delimiter: /\n    source:\n      - 'fedora://csv_migration'\n      - '@filename'\n</code></pre> <p>That's because the migrate framework only interprets <code>source</code> values as names of columns from the CSV or names of other process steps.  Even if they're wrapped in quotes.  It will never try to use the string directly as a value.  To circumvent this, we declare a constant in the <code>source</code> section of the migration config.</p> <pre><code>  constants:\n    destination_dir: 'fedora://csv_migration'\n</code></pre> <p>This constant can be referenced as <code>constants/destination_dir</code> and passed into the concat process plugin as a <code>source</code>.</p> <p>There are a lot more process plugins available through the (core) Migrate and Migrate Plus modules, and they are documented on Drupal.org.</p>","location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#the-process-section-in-depth"},{"title":"Running the File Migration","text":"<p>Migrations can be executed via <code>drush</code> using the <code>migrate:import</code> command.

If values contained special characters such as colons, quotes would be needed.</p> <p>If you look at the <code>process</code> section, you can see we're taking the <code>title</code>, <code>description</code>, and <code>issued</code> columns from the CSV and applying them directly to the migrated nodes without any manipulation.</p> <pre><code>  title: title\n  field_description: description\n  field_edtf_date: issued\n</code></pre> <p>For <code>subtitle</code>, we're passing it through the <code>skip_on_empty</code> process plugin because not every row in our CSV has a subtitle entry.  It's very useful when you have spotty data, and you'll end up using it a lot.  The <code>method: process</code> bit tells the migrate framework only skip that particular field if the value is empty, and not to skip the whole row.  It's important, so don't forget it.  The full YAML for setting <code>field_alternative_title</code> from subtitle looks like this:</p> <pre><code>  field_alternative_title:\n    plugin: skip_on_empty\n    source: subtitle\n    method: process\n</code></pre> <p>Now here's where things get interesting.  We can look up other entities to populate entity reference fields.  For example, all Repository Items have an entity reference field that holds a taxonomy term from the <code>islandora_models</code> vocabulary.  All of our examples are images, so we'll look up the Image model in the vocabulary since it already exists (it gets made for you when you use islandora-playbook).  We use the <code>entity_lookup</code> process plugin to do this.</p> <pre><code>  field_model:\n    plugin: entity_lookup\n    source: constants/model\n    entity_type: taxonomy_term\n    # 'name' is the string value of the term, e.g. 'Original file', 'Thumbnail'.\n    value_key: name\n    bundle_key: vid\n    bundle: islandora_models\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>entity_lookup</code> process plugin looks up an entity based on the configuration you give it.  You use the <code>entity_type</code>, <code>bundle_key</code>, and <code>bundle</code> configurations to limit which entities you search through.  <code>entity_type</code> is, as you'd suspect, the type of entity: node, media, file, taxonomy_term, etc...  <code>bundle_key</code> tells the migrate framework which property holds the bundle of the entity, and <code>bundle</code> is the actual bundle id you want to restrict by. In this case we specify the vid (vocabulary id) has to be <code>islandora_models</code> - which is the machine name of the vocabulary we're interested in. In this plugin, <code>source</code> is the value to search for - in this case we're looking for the string \"Image\", which we've defined as a constant.  And we're comparing it to the <code>name</code> field on each term by setting the <code>value_key</code> config.</p> <p>This approach applies the same taxonomy term to all objects. If you want to assign a taxonomy term at the node level (that is, potentially a different term for each node) rather than to all the nodes being imported, you can use a configuration as illustrated next. In this example, we have a column in our CSV input file with the header 'model', which we define as the source of the <code>field_model</code> values:</p> <pre><code>  field_model:\n    plugin: entity_lookup\n    # 'model' is the header of a field in our input CSV that contains the string value of the taxonomy term.\n    source: model\n    entity_type: taxonomy_term\n    value_key: name\n    bundle_key: vid\n    bundle: islandora_models\n</code></pre> <p>If you're not sure that the entities you're looking up already exist, you can use the <code>entity_generate</code> plugin, which takes the same config, but will create a new entity if the lookup fails.  We use this plugin to create <code>subject</code> taxonomy terms that we tag our nodes with.  A node can have multiple subjects, so we've encoded them in the CSV as pipe delimited strings.</p>    subject     Neon signs|Night   Neon signs|Night|Funny   Neon signs|Night   Drinking|Neon signs   Neon signs    <p>We can hack those apart easily enough.  In PHP we'd do something like</p> <pre><code>$subjects = explode($string, '|');\n$terms = [];\nforeach ($subjects as $name) {\n    $terms[] = \\Drupal::service('entity_type.manager')-&gt;getStorage('taxonomy_term')-&gt;create([\n        ...\n        'vid' =&gt; 'subject',\n        'name' =&gt; $name,\n        ...\n    ]);\n}\n$node-&gt;set('field_subject', $terms);\n</code></pre> <p>With process plugins, that logic looks like</p> <pre><code>field_subject:\n    -\n      plugin: skip_on_empty\n      source: subject\n      method: process\n    -\n      plugin: explode\n      delimiter: '|'\n    -\n      plugin: entity_generate\n      entity_type: taxonomy_term\n      value_key: name\n      bundle_key: vid\n      bundle: subject\n</code></pre> <p>Here we've got a small pipeline that uses the <code>skip_on_empty</code> process plugin, which we've already seen, followed by <code>explode</code>.  The <code>explode</code> process plugin operates exactly like its PHP counterpart, taking an array and a delimiter as input.  The combination of <code>skip_on_empty</code> and <code>explode</code> behave like a foreach loop on the explode results.  If we have an empty string, nothing happens.  If there's one or more pipe delimited subject names in the string, then <code>entity_generate</code> gets called for each name that's found.  The <code>entity_generate</code> process plugin will try to look up a subject by name, and if that fails, it creates one using the name and saves a reference to it in the node.  So <code>entity_generate</code> is actually smarter than our pseudo-code above, because it can be run over and over again and it won't duplicate entities. :champagne:</p>","location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#ingesting-nodes"},{"title":"Complex Fields","text":"<p>Some fields don't hold just a single type of value.  In other words, not everything is just text, numbers, or references.  Using Drupal 8's Typed Data API, fields can hold groups of named values with different types.  Consider a field that holds an RGB color.  You could set it with PHP like so:</p> <pre><code>$node-&gt;set('field_color', ['R' =&gt; 255, 'G' =&gt; 255, 'B' =&gt; 255]);\n</code></pre> <p>You could even  have a multi-valued color field, and do something like this</p> <pre><code>$node-&gt;set('field_color', [\n  ['R' =&gt; 0, 'G' =&gt; 0, 'B' =&gt; 0],\n  ['R' =&gt; 255, 'G' =&gt; 255, 'B' =&gt; 255],\n]);\n</code></pre> <p>In the migrate framework, you have two options for handling these types of fields.

This example would reference taxonomy_term 1 and give it the relator for \"Contributor\".</p> <p>If we have a single name to deal with, we can set those values in YAML, accessing <code>field_linked_agent/target_id</code> and <code>field_linked_agent/rel_type</code> independently.</p> <pre><code>  field_linked_agent/target_id:\n    plugin: entity_generate\n    source: photographer\n    entity_type: taxonomy_term\n    value_key: name\n    bundle_key: vid\n    bundle: person\n\n  field_linked_agent/rel_type: constants/relator\n</code></pre> <p>Here we're looking at the <code>photographer</code> column in the CSV, which contains the names of the photographers that captured these images.  Since we know these are photographers, and not publishers or editors, we can bake in the <code>relator</code> constant we set to <code>relators:pht</code> in the <code>source</code> section of the migration.  So all that's left to do is to set the taxonomy term's id via <code>entity_generate</code>.  If the lookup succeeds, the id is returned.  If it fails, a term is created and its id is returned.  In the end, by using the <code>/</code> syntax to set properties on complex fields, everything gets wrapped up into that nice associative array structure for you automatically.</p> <p>However, if you have multiple names, and/or multiple columns that contain values that will go into the same <code>typed_relation</code> field, you do need to build up a full array of structured data.</p> <p>We start by extracting the values in the <code>photographer</code> column, and busting them into a list. (In this case, given the sample data, the lists will all have length 1). Then, we use a custom process plugin to make each value the value in an associative array (see example data below).</p> <pre><code>  photographers:\n    -\n      source: photographer\n      plugin: skip_on_empty\n      method: process\n    -\n      plugin: explode\n      delimiter: '|'\n    -\n      plugin: str_to_assoc\n      key: 'name'\n</code></pre> <p>So, if we started with a column containing</p> <pre><code>'Alice|Bob|Charlie'\n</code></pre> <p>at the end of this pipeline, the <code>photographers</code> temporary variable would contain</p> <pre><code>[\n  ['name' =&gt; 'Alice'],\n  ['name' =&gt; 'Bob'],\n  ['name' =&gt; 'Charlie]\n]\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we use the <code>sub_process</code> plugin. It takes an array of associative arrays (as seen above) and iterates over them. From within subprocess' <code>process</code> parameter, you can access only what's defined in that associative array. Here, when we do our <code>entity_generate</code> lookup, our source is <code>name</code>, the (only) key in that array.</p> <pre><code>  linked_agent_pht:\n    plugin: sub_process\n    source: '@photographers'\n    process:\n      target_id:\n        plugin: entity_generate\n        source: name\n        entity_type: taxonomy_term\n        value_key: name\n        bundle_key: vid\n        bundle: person\n      rel_type:\n        plugin: default_value\n        default_value: 'relators:pht'\n\n</code></pre> <p>Within <code>sub_process</code>, we cannot access the temporary variables or constants that we've created in the outer migration. This is why we use the <code>default_value</code> plugin when for the <code>rel_type</code>. It would have been simpler to define a constant as we did with 'Image', but we wouldn't be able to access it. The output of this pipeline is now formatted as the structured data expected by a <code>typed_relation</code> field:</p> <pre><code>[\n  ['target_id' =&gt; 42, 'rel_type' =&gt; 'relators:pht' ],\n  ['target_id' =&gt; 43, 'rel_type' =&gt; 'relators:pht' ],\n  ['target_id' =&gt; 44, 'rel_type' =&gt; 'relators:pht' ],\n]\n</code></pre> <p>The final step will be to assign this array to the Linked Agent field. But first, we repeat the process for another column, which contains names that have a different relator, and a different bundle. Finally, we merge the two temporary variables and pass the result to <code>field_linked_agent</code>. We don't have to assign the sub-components of <code>field_linked_agent</code> here, because this is already the structured data it is looking for.</p> <pre><code>  field_linked_agent:\n    plugin: merge\n    source:\n      - '@linked_agent_pht'\n      - '@linked_agent_prv'\n</code></pre> <p>Clear as mud? Great.  Now let's run that migration.</p>","location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#complex-fields"},{"title":"Running the node migration","text":"<p>Like with the file migration, run <code>drush -y --userid=1 --uri=http://localhost:8000 migrate:import node</code> from anywhere within the Drupal installation directory will fire off the migration.  Go to http://localhost:8000/admin/content and you should see five new nodes.  Click on one, though, and you'll see it's just a stub with metadata.  The CSV metadata is there, links to other entities like subjects and photographers are there, but there's no trace of the corresponding files.  Here's where media entities come into play.</p>","location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#running-the-node-migration"},{"title":"Migrating Media","text":"<p>Media entities are Drupal's solution for fieldable files.  Since you can't put fields on a file, what you can do is wrap the file with a Media entity. In addition to a reference to the file (binary), technical metadata and structural metadata for the file go on the Media entity (e.g.  MIME type, file size, resolution).  Media also have a few special fields that are required for Islandora, <code>field_media_of</code> and <code>field_use</code>, which denote what node owns the media and what role the media serves, respectively.  Since the Media entity references both the file it wraps and the node that owns it, Media entities act as a bridge between files and nodes, tying them together.  And to do this, we make use of one last process plugin, <code>migration_lookup</code>.  Open up <code>/var/www/html/drupal/web/modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/config/install/migrate_plus.migration.media.yml</code> and give it a look.</p> <pre><code># Uninstall this config when the feature is uninstalled\ndependencies:\n  enforced:\n    module:\n      - migrate_islandora_csv\n\nid: media\nlabel: Import Media from CSV\nmigration_group: migrate_islandora_csv\n\nsource:\n  plugin: csv\n  path: modules/contrib/migrate_islandora_csv/data/migration.csv\n\n  # 1 means you have a header row, 0 means you don't\n  header_row_count: 1\n\n  # Each migration needs a unique key per row in the csv.

There's no string or array manipulation in YAML, and at most there's only one process plugin per field. Title and user are set directly, with no processing required</p> <pre><code>  name: title\n  uid: constants/uid\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>field_media_use</code> field is a tag that's used to denote the purpose of a file with regard to the node it belongs to.  E.g. is this the original file? a lower quality derivative? thumbnail? etc...  In many ways it bears a resemblance to DSID in Islandora 7.x.  Like <code>field_model</code> with nodes, the vocabulary already exists in your Islandora install, so all you have to do is look it up with the <code>entity_lookup</code> plugin.</p> <pre><code>  # Make the media an 'Original File'\n  field_media_use:\n    plugin: entity_lookup\n    source: constants/use\n    entity_type: taxonomy_term\n    value_key: name\n    bundle_key: vid\n    bundle: islandora_media_use\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>field_media_image</code> and <code>field_media_of</code> fields are how the media binds a file to a node.  You could use <code>entity_lookup</code> or <code>entity_generate</code>, but we've already migrated them and can very easily look them up by the id assigned to them during migration.  But what's the benefit of doing so?  The <code>entity_lookup</code> and <code>entity_generate</code> process plugins do the job fine, right?</p> <p>The main advantage of using <code>migration_lookup</code> and defining migrations whenever possible, is that migrated entities can be rolled back.  If you were to hop into your console and execute</p> <pre><code>drush -y --uri=http://localhost:8000 migrate:rollback --group migrate_islandora_csv\n</code></pre> <p>Your nodes, media, and files would all be gone.  But your subjects and photographers would remain.

You've seen how to transform data with pipelines of processing plugins and can handle numeric, text, and entity reference fields.  You can handle multiple values for fields, and even more complicated things like <code>typed_relation</code> fields.  And as big as this walkthrough was, we're only scratching the surface of what can be done with the Migrate API.</p>","location":"technical-documentation/migrate-csv/#what-have-we-learned"},{"title":"Where to go from here?","text":"<p>There's certainly more you can do with Drupal 8's Migrate API.  There's a plethora of source and processing plugins out there that can handle pretty much anything you throw at it.  XML and JSON are fair game.  You can also request sources using HTTP, so you can always point it at an existing systems REST API and go from there.  If you can't make the Migrate API's existing workflow make the necessary changes to your data, you can expand its capabilities by writing your own process plugins. Reading the Drupal.org documentation on the Migrate API would be a good place to start.</p> <p>But really the best thing to do is try and get your data into Islandora!  We intend to create a <code>boilerplate</code> branch of this repository that will allow you to clone down a migration template, ready for you to customize to fit your data.  And as you assemble it into CSV format, keep in mind that if you have more than just names for things like subjects and authors, that you can always make more CSVs.  Think of it like maintaining tables in an SQL database.  Each CSV has unique keys, so you can lookup/join entities between CSVs using those keys.  And you can still pipe-delimit the keys like we did in our example to handle multi-valued fields.</p> <p>In some repositories, these CSVs can be used to make bulk updates to metadata. Just make your changes to maintain the CSVs, then run the migration(s) again with the --update flag. This will not always be efficient, as you'll update every entity, even if it didn't change. But, by breaking down your CSVs per collection or object type, you could keep them small enough to use this process for a small repository.</p> <p>There is also a tool for migrating directly from a Legacy Islandora to Islandora (migrate_7x_claw), using Solr, XPaths, and Fedora calls to pull files and objects directly into Islandora.

Otherwise you will receive a <code>401 Unauthorized</code> response.</p> <p>If you do provide credentials but don't have permission, you will receive a <code>403 Forbidden</code> response.</p> <p>You can find more information about Authorization here</p> <p>\ud83c\udf4e For example:</p> <pre><code>curl -i -X POST -u admin:islandora -H\"Content-type: application/json\" --data '{\"type\":[{\"target_id\":\"islandora_object\",\"target_type\":\"node_type\"}],\"title\":[{\"value\":\"Created a collection with POST\"}],\"field_model\":[{\"target_id\":23,\"target_type\":\"taxonomy_term\"}]}' 'http://localhost:8000/node?_format=json'\n\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nDate: Tue, 05 Mar 2019 18:07:00 GMT\nServer: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)\nX-Powered-By: PHP/7.1.26-1+ubuntu16.04.1+deb.sury.org+1\nLocation: http://localhost:8000/node/3\nCache-Control: must-revalidate, no-cache, private\nX-UA-Compatible: IE=edge\nContent-language: en\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nExpires: Sun, 19 Nov 1978 05:00:00 GMT\nVary:\nX-Generator: Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)\nContent-Length: 1564\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\"nid\":[{\"value\":3}],\"uuid\":[{\"value\":\"3f618cdc-3f2a-4e77-b932-9ff1d461a57a\"}],\"vid\":[{\"value\":3}],\"langcode\":[{\"value\":\"en\"}],\"type\":[{\"target_id\":\"islandora_object\",\"target_type\":\"node_type\",\"target_uuid\":\"62189bec-3ef3-4196-b847-b17e5ce61fd5\"}],\"revision_timestamp\":[{\"value\":\"2019-03-05T18:07:00+00:00\",\"format\":\"Y-m-d\\\\TH:i:sP\"}],\"revision_uid\":[{\"target_id\":1,\"target_type\":\"user\",\"target_uuid\":\"46a47057-de2d-4ce2-87ae-dbe4551209b8\",\"url\":\"\\/user\\/1\"}],\"revision_log\":[],\"status\":[{\"value\":true}],\"title\":[{\"value\":\"Created a collection with POST\"}],\"uid\":[{\"target_id\":1,\"target_type\":\"user\",\"target_uuid\":\"46a47057-de2d-4ce2-87ae-dbe4551209b8\",\"url\":\"\\/user\\/1\"}],\"created\":[{\"value\":\"2019-03-05T18:07:00+00:00\",\"format\":\"Y-m-d\\\\TH:i:sP\"}],\"changed\":[{\"value\":\"2019-03-05T18:07:00+00:00\",\"format\":\"Y-m-d\\\\TH:i:sP\"}],\"promote\":[{\"value\":true}],\"sticky\":[{\"value\":false}],\"default_langcode\":[{\"value\":true}],\"revision_translation_affected\":[{\"value\":true}],\"content_translation_source\":[{\"value\":\"und\"}],\"content_translation_outdated\":[{\"value\":false}],\"field_access_terms\":[],\"field_alternative_title\":[],\"field_description\":[],\"field_display_hints\":[],\"field_edtf_date\":[],\"field_edtf_date_created\":[],\"field_edtf_date_issued\":[],\"field_extent\":[{\"value\":\"1 item\"}],\"field_identifier\":[],\"field_linked_agent\":[],\"field_member_of\":[],\"field_model\":[{\"target_id\":23,\"target_type\":\"taxonomy_term\",\"target_uuid\":\"6a3b293d-4617-417b-99d2-23d75b57f7c2\",\"url\":\"\\/taxonomy\\/term\\/23\"}],\"field_pid\":[],\"field_resource_type\":[],\"field_rights\":[],\"field_subject\":[]}\n</code></pre> <p>The parts of the above request are:</p> <ol> <li><code>-i</code> - return the response headers</li> <li><code>-X POST</code> - send a POST request</li> <li><code>-u admin:islandora</code> - use these basic authentication credentials</li> <li><code>-H\"Content-type: application/json\"</code> - send the content-type header</li> <li><code>--data '{...}'</code> - send the request body (seen above)</li> <li><code>'http://localhost:8000/node?_format=json'</code> - the endpoint of the request</li> </ol>","location":"technical-documentation/rest-create/#content-nodes"},{"title":"Files and Media","text":"<p>The Drupal REST UI is supposed to have a way to upload files, but this seems to require the use of an X-CSRF-Token, which can only be retrieved using Cookie authentication and even then does not allow you to upload.</p> <p>However there is a special REST endpoint created by Islandora, which is less configurable and is not part of the above-mentioned REST UI.</p> <p>This endpoint is available at <code>http://localhost:8000/node/{node id}/media/{media type}/{media use}</code></p> <p>It only accepts PUT requests.

Some examples of blocks are your site's menu, breadcrumbs, search block, etc...  You have a lot of control over when and where you see blocks using Drupal's administrative interface.   You can create and delete blocks, as well as move them around in different locations on the page (called 'regions' in Drupal theme terminology).  You can also control on which pages the blocks are visible, allowing you to conditionally show/hide them as appropriate.  Blocks are made available to place by enabling the Drupal modules that provide them, and there's lots out there to choose from.  Placing blocks is an essential skill for any site administrator, so let's jump right in and get our hands dirty. There are two methods discussed here: the \"Block Layout\" interface, and using \"Contexts\". There is a third option, \"Display Suite,\" that is not discussed here.</p>","location":"tutorials/blocks/"},{"title":"Using Block Layout","text":"<p></p> <p>Using the admin toolbar, navigate to Admin &gt; Structure &gt; Block layout (admin/structure/block).  You will see a table listing all of the available regions provided by the current theme for block placement.  You can switch between available themes using the tabs above the table.  For each region, enabled blocks are listed and can be re-arranged.  Take a look at the \"Main Content\" region for example.</p> <p></p> <p>If you wanted to move the content above its tabs, you could drag the \"Main page content\" block above the \"Tabs\" block. If you scroll all the way down to the bottom and click the \"Save blocks\" button, now when you go to view content you should see something like this</p> <p></p> <p>If you want to add a new block to a region, hit the \"Place block\" button for that region and you'll be brought to a modal that will let you select which block to place.</p> <p></p> <p>After selecting your block, you will be brought to its configuration form.</p> <p></p> <p>Here you can give the block a different title, change its region using a dropdown, and control its visibility settings by configuring various conditions. In our case, we're adding the \"Development\" block to the \"Footer\" region. And since we want to see this block everywhere, we'll leave the visibility settings alone for now.  Click the \"Save block\" button, and now if we go view some content we should see the \"Development\" menu in the footer of our site.</p> <p></p> <p>If we want to limit this eyesore to only the front page of our site, we can revisit the visibility settings of the block. Navigate to the block we just placed on the block placement page, and click its \"Configure\" button.  Here you can limit the block to show only for certain roles or content types.  You can also explicitly set a white or black list of pages, which is what we'll do.</p> <p></p> <p>Click the Pages tab and you'll have a text area you can list pages in.  We're going to enter <code>&lt;front&gt;</code>, which is a special value that means \"The front page of your site\".

They cover the majority of use cases, however, there are times when you need even more control.  This is where the Context module really shines. Any condition available to the Context module can be used to control block visibility.  And you can even combine conditions using Boolean (AND/OR) logic.</p> <p>For example, in the <code>islandora_defaults</code> feature, we provide a context specifically for showing a list of members of a collection. All of our content is the same content type (Repository Item), and Collections are distinguished by being tagged with the \"Collection\" taxonomy term.  Using the admin toolbar, if you navigate to Admin &gt; Structure &gt; Context (admin/structure/context), you should see a list of all contexts available to the site.</p> <p></p> <p>Click the \"Configure\" button on the \"Collection\" context.</p> <p></p> <p>You can see in its \"Condition\" section, we have the \"Node has term\" condition, which checks for content tagged with the term provided by the user.  In this case, it's set to look for the \"Collection\" tag.  Underneath, in the \"Reaction\" section, you can see that the \"Block\" reaction has been selected, and its configuration looks a lot like the core block placement UI. The only difference here is that when the \"Include blocks from block layout\" box is checked, you are only placing the blocks you want to add in addition to an already existing block layout.  If you uncheck the box, you are creating an entirely new block layout from scratch, and will have to replace basic things like breadcrumbs and menus.</p> <p></p> <p>Here you can see we've added only the members block to this block layout.  If we go and navigate to a collection, you'll see its list of members underneath its content.</p> <p></p> <p>If we edit the collection and change its model tag from \"Collection\" to anything else, you'll see the block disappears!</p> <p></p> <p>As you can see, block placement can be very flexible, and allow you to customize your site in a very granular fashion.

For a step-by-step demonstration, see the tutorial Create a resource node.</p> <p>A resource node holds the descriptive metadata for an Islandora object, as well as groups together the various files that are part of the object for preservation or display, such as the original file  and various derivative files generated from it.</p> <p>The model for exactly what constitutes an object in Islandora is flexible and can be adapted to the needs of specific users. For example, the Islandora Defaults configuration considers an object as a resource node of the type \"Repository Item\"  which contains descriptive metadata about the object. Attached to that Node are one or more Media, each representing a file that is part of this object, such as \"Original File\", \"Thumbnail\", \"Preservation Master\", etc. With this model, every original file uploaded into Islandora has its own resource node.</p> <p>Multi-file Media configurations also attach Media to a parent node, but allow for that node to be represented by multiple \"Original File\"s. In this model, a Media contains the original file as well as any derivative files created from it (thumbnail, service file, etc.).</p> <p>For an example of where these two different approaches could apply, the basic configuration might make sense for a book that has rich page-level metadata, so that each page would be its own Node with its own metadata record; the multi-file media configuration might be a better fit for a book that does not have page-level metadata (except an ordering or page numbers), so that each Media would represent one page, and all pages (Media) would be attached to a single parent Node/metadata record for the entire book.</p> <p>As we learned in the introduction, objects in an Islandora repository are represented as a combination of resource nodes, media, and files in Drupal. Because of this, their metadata profile, display, form (and much more) are configurable through the Drupal UI.  This gives repository administrators a huge degree of control over their repository without any need for coding. Much more so than ever before. And since we're using a core Drupal solution for modeling our resource nodes and media, compatibility with third-party modules is virtually guaranteed.

Most of what we would think of as descriptive metadata is stored as fields.

For example, you might have a content type for a set of repository objects that have very specialized metadata requirements but another content type for generic repository objects that share a more general set of metadata fields.

You may be familiar with the \"full\" and \"teaser\" versions of nodes, which are rendered using two corresponding display modes. Islandora makes use of display modes to control how media content is displayed. Islandora Defaults provides two display modes for Media, one which renders the OpenSeadragon viewer and the other which renders the pdf.js viewer. These two display modes can be enabled by using \"Display hints\" in the node edit form, or you can configure Islandora to use a specific display mode for all media based on the file's Mime type. Both methods make use of Contexts.</p> <p>To set the display mode on the resource node's edit form, select the display mode you want to use for that node in the Display hints field:</p> <p></p> <p>Due to the associated Context configurations (\"OpenSeadragon\" and \"PDFjs Viewer\") that are shipped with Islandora Defaults, the selected display mode will then be used when the resource node's page is rendered.</p> <p>At a global level, there are a couple of ways to tell Drupal to use the PDFjs viewer to render the content of the media field whenever the media has a Mime type of <code>application/pdf</code>.</p> <p>The first way is to edit the \"PDFjs Viewer\" Context. By default, this Context tells Drupal to use the PDFjs viewer if the node has the term \"PDFjs\" (yes, that's a taxonomy term):</p> <p></p> <p>If you add the Condition \"Node has Media with Mime type\" and configure it to use <code>application/pdf</code> as the Mime type, like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Context will use whichever Condition applies (as long as you don't check \"Require all conditions\"). That is, if the \"PDFjs\" display hint option in the node edit form is checked, or if the node's media has a Mime type of <code>application/pdf</code>, the media content will be rendered using the PDFjs viewer.</p> <p>The second way to use the media's Mime type to render its content with the PDFjs viewer is to create a separate Context that will detect the media's Mime type and use the configured display mode automatically.

From that point on, whenever the media for a node has the configured Mime type, Drupal will render the media using the corresponding display mode.</p> <p>The node-level and global approaches are not exclusive to one another. One Context can override another depending on the order of execution. Contexts are applied in the order they are displayed on the Contexts page, which is editable through a drag-and-drop interface. Whichever Condition appears last in the list of Contexts between the node-level Condition (which in this case is the \"Node has term\" condition) the global Condition (which is \"Node has Media with Mime type\"), that one will override the other. An example of having the display mode specified in the node edit form intentionally override the display mode based on Mime type is to have media with the <code>image/jp2</code> mime-type configured to use the OpenSeadragon viewer, but to manually select the OpenSeadragon display mode for nodes with JPEG media (for example, a very large JPEG image of a map, where the OpenSeadragon's pan and zoom features would be useful).</p>","location":"user-documentation/content_models/#display-modes"},{"title":"Members","text":"<p>Islandora has a notion of membership, which is used to create a parent/child relationship between nodes.

In Islandora Legacy, objects (video files, audio files, PDFs, etc.) are loaded through the user interface, and Datastreams are generated automatically. These consist of access and display copies, the metadata, OCH/HOCR, technical metadata, and more. All of these Datastreams are directly connected to the object and accessed through the admin interface.</p> <p>In Islandora, the traditional Islandora Legacy objects (video files, audio files, etc. that were represented in different content models) are now Drupal nodes. Islandora object nodes are a special kind of Drupal node, distinct from nodes that exist for other content types such as a blog post, an article, a page (like the About page on a site), and others. These Islandora objects are still loaded through the interface and described with the data entry form, and derivatives are still generated. However, the Datastreams are no longer connected to the original object in the same immutable way. Each of these Datastreams can be manipulated through Drupal by non-developers. You can create a variety of ways to view this metadata and information related to the objects. Doing so requires knowledge of Drupal 8, but this essentially means that there are many ways to view the metadata and access the related objects in Islandora.</p> <p>In Islandora it is therefore helpful to think of objects as resource nodes. The term reflects the new nature of objects in Islandora. A resource node does not just refer to the individual object file, but encompasses multiple elements that all relate to each other, even if they are no longer directly connected like objects in Islandora Legacy.</p> <p>The typical elements of a resource node:</p> <ul> <li>A content type defining metadata fields defined for the node. A content type may include any number of custom fields defined to store descriptive metadata about the object represented by the node. To function as an Islandora resource node, a content type must define two further fields:<ul> <li>A field denoting the 'type' of thing represented by the node (image, book, newspaper, etc.). The value of this field is used by Islandora to control views, derivative processing, and other behavior.[^1]</li> <li>A field in which to record the node's membership in another node. If populated, this field creates a hierarchical relationship between parent (the node recorded in the field) and child (the node in which the parent is recorded). This may be left empty, but is required for building hierarchies for collections, subcollections, and members of collections, as well as objects (books, \"compound objects\", etc.) consisting of paged content.[^2]</li> </ul> </li> <li>Media files (the actual files of JPEGs, MP3s, .zip, etc.) that get loaded through the form</li> <li>Derivative files (thumbnails, web-friendly service files, technical metadata, and more)</li> </ul> <p>These resource nodes are what the librarian, student, archivist, technician, or general non-developer creates through the data entry form. It is possible to configure all elements of a resource node in Islandora through Drupal. This fact allows control over how one accesses the node and how nodes are displayed and discovered online by non-developers. It also allows a repository to take full advantage of all third-party Drupal modules, themes, and distributions available.</p>","location":"user-documentation/content_models/#islandora-legacy-objects-versus-islandora-resource-nodes"},{"title":"Creating and updating content types","text":"","location":"user-documentation/content_types/"},{"title":"Overview","text":"<p>Since metadata in Islandora is stored as fields in Nodes, the standard Drupal Content Types system provides our 'ingest forms'.

For example, the title field of a content model can be mapped to <code>dcterms:title</code> and/or <code>schema:title</code>. In Islandora, triples expressed by these mappings get synced to Fedora and indexed in the Blazegraph triplestore. RDF mappings are defined/stored in Drupal as a YAML file (to learn more about YAML, there are several tutorials on the web. Currently, Drupal 8 does not have a UI to create/update RDF mappings to ontologies other than Schema.org. This requires repository managers to update the configuration files themselves. Consider using the RDF mappings included in islandora_defaults as templates by copying and modifying one to meet your needs.</p> <p>The Drupal 8 Configuration Synchronization export (e.g. <code>http://localhost:8000/admin/config/development/configuration/single/export</code>) and import (e.g. <code>http://localhost:8000/admin/config/development/configuration/single/import</code>) can be used to get a copy of the mappings for editing in a text editor before being uploaded again. Alternatively, a repository manager can update the configuration on the server and use Features to import the edits.</p> <p>An RDF mapping configuration file has two main areas: the mapping's metadata and the mapping itself. Most of the mapping's metadata should be left alone unless you are creating a brand-new mapping for a new Content Type or Taxonomy Vocabulary. A partial example from islandora_default's islandora_object (Repository Item) is included below:</p> <pre><code>langcode: en\nstatus: true\ndependencies:\n  config:\n    - node.type.islandora_object\n  enforced:\n    module:\n      - islandora_demo\n  module:\n    - node\nid: node.islandora_object\ntargetEntityType: node\nbundle: islandora_object\ntypes:\n  - 'pcdm:Object'\nfieldMappings:\n  title:\n    properties:\n      - 'dc:title'\n  field_alternative_title:\n    properties:\n      - 'dc:alternative'\n  field_edtf_date:\n    properties:\n      - 'dc:date'\n    datatype_callback:\n      callable: 'Drupal\\controlled_access_terms\\EDTFConverter::dateIso8601Value'\n  field_description:\n    properties:\n      - 'dc:description'\n</code></pre> <p>The required mapping metadata fields when creating a brand-new mapping include the <code>id</code>, <code>status</code>, <code>targetEntityType</code>, and <code>bundle</code>. (<code>uuid</code> and <code>_core</code>, not seen in the example above but may be present in exported copies,  will be added by Drupal automatically.) <code>bundle</code> is the machine name for the Content Type or Taxonomy Vocabulary you are creating the mapping for. <code>targetEntityType</code> is <code>node</code> for Content Types or <code>taxonomy_term</code> for Taxonomy Vocabularies. The <code>id</code> configuration is a concatenation of target entity type and bundle ('node' and 'islandora_object' in the example above). The <code>id</code> is also used to name the configuration file: e.g. <code>rdf.mapping.node.islandora_object.yml</code> is <code>rdf.mapping.</code> plus the id (<code>node.islandora_object</code>) and then <code>.yml</code>.</p> <p>The mapping itself consists of the <code>types</code>' and <code>fieldMappings</code> configurations.</p> <p>All the mappings use RDF namespaces instead of fully-qualified URIs. For example, the type for islandora_object is <code>pcdm:Object</code> instead of <code>http://pcdm.org/models#Object</code>. Unfortunately, the available namespaces are defined in module hooks (hook_rdf_namespaces) rather than in a configuration file. Repository managers wanting to add additional namespaces need to create their own module and implement hook_rdf_namespaces. See the islandora_defaults hook implementation for an example.</p> <p>Namespaces currently supported (ordered by the module that supplies them) include:</p> <ul> <li>rdf<ul> <li>content: http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/</li> <li>dc: http://purl.org/dc/terms/</li> <li>foaf: http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/</li> <li>og: http://ogp.me/ns#</li> <li>rdfs: http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#</li> <li>schema: http://schema.org/</li> <li>sioc: http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#</li> <li>sioct: http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#</li> <li>skos: http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#</li> <li>xsd: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#</li> </ul> </li> <li>islandora<ul> <li>ldp: http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#</li> <li>dc11: http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/</li> <li>nfo: http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/03/22/nfo/v1.1/</li> <li>ebucore: http://www.ebu.ch/metadata/ontologies/ebucore/ebucore#</li> <li>fedora: http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#</li> <li>owl: http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#</li> <li>ore: http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/</li> <li>rdf: http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#</li> <li>islandora: http://islandora.ca</li> <li>pcdm: http://pcdm.org/models#</li> <li>use: http://pcdm.org/use#</li> <li>iana: http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/</li> </ul> </li> <li>islandora_demo<ul> <li>relators: http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/</li> </ul> </li> <li>controlled_access_terms<ul> <li>wgs84_pos: http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#</li> <li>org: https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/#org:</li> <li>xs: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The <code>types</code> corresponds to the <code>rdf:type</code> predicate (which corresponds to JSON-LD's <code>@type</code>) and can have multiple values.

For example, the Corporate Body Vocabulary (provided by the Controlled Access Terms Default Configuration module) has <code>schema:Organization</code> set as the default type in the RDF mapping. However, more granular types may apply to one organization and not another, such as <code>schema:GovernmentOrganization</code> or <code>schema:Corporation</code>. The <code>alter_jsonld_type</code> Context reaction allows Content Types and Taxonomy Vocabularies to add a field's values as <code>rdf:types</code> to its JSON-LD serialization (the format used to index a node or taxonomy term in Fedora and the triple-store).</p> <p><code>fieldMappings</code> specifies the fields to be included, their RDF property mappings, and any necessary data converters (the <code>datatype_callback</code>). One field can be mapped to more than one RDF property by adding them to the field's properties list. The <code>datatype_callback</code> is defined by the 'callable' key and the fully qualified static method used to convert it to the desired data format. For example, fields of the Drupal datetime type need to be converted to ISO 8601 values, so we use the <code>Drupal\\rdf\\CommonDataConverter::dateIso8601Value</code> function to perform the conversion.</p>  <p>Islandora Quick Lessons</p> <p>Learn more with this video on Customizing a Form.</p>","location":"user-documentation/content_types/#updating-and-creating-an-rdf-mapping"},{"title":"Context","text":"","location":"user-documentation/context/"},{"title":"Context in Islandora","text":"<p>Context is a Drupal contrib module that allows configuration of \"if this, then that\" logic using an administrative user interface. Context defines \"conditions\" and \"reactions\" to enact the \"if this [condition], then that [reaction]\" logic.

Context in Drupal 8 (and above) is much more powerful than in Drupal 7 due to how it interacts with the rest of Drupal (specifically, through Drupal 8's new plugin API). Because of this increased flexibility and power, and because Context provides a ready-made user interface for site administrators to combine conditions and reactions, Islandora uses Context to drive the logic underlying many important aspects of Islandora, including which derivatives get generated and how objects are displayed.

An implication of this is some configuration options relevant to the outcome of the \"then that\" reaction are configured in the Action admin interface (located at <code>admin/config/system/actions</code>), not within the Context admin interface (located at <code>admin/structure/context</code>). While this makes for a clunky admin experience, the advantage is that it allows the reuse of a single piece of Drupal code in multiple Contexts.</p> <p>One important group of functionality in Islandora repositories that admins might want to control is what types of media get persisted to Fedora. Islandora allows administrators to choose what types of media get persisted to Fedora and what types of media get persisted to the Drupal public file system. For example, you may want to persist your thumbnails to Fedora along with your \"Preservation Master\" and \"Original File\" files. This can be accomplished using Context.</p> <p>By default, Islandora stores thumbnails in Drupal's public file system, not in Fedora. Thumbnails are automatically generated by a Context (the \"Image Service File\" Context to be specific), but if you want to change the file system where your thumbnails are stored to the Fedora file system, you need to change that setting in the \"Image - Generate a thumbnail from a service file\" Action, not in the Context that uses that action:</p> <p></p> <p>This configuration should be done as part of your initial Islandora setup, since there is currently no way to move thumbnails that were persisted to Drupal's public file system to Fedora, or vice versa. But, at least site admins can choose one or the other using this Action.</p> <p>You can create custom Actions and then use them in Contexts.

Then, in the Open Seadragon Block Context, make sure the term used in the \"Node has term\" condition (you can register more than one term there).

Set up as many as you need, for example, Thumbnail, Service File, Extracted text, etc. Note that the \"Media Use\" field is no longer relevant for multi-file media bundles, as a single media instance of this type contains all \"Media Uses\" (e.g. derivatives) in different fields.</li> <li>Create a derivative Action that uses one of the two existing multi-file media base actions: \"Generate a Derivative File For Media Attachment\" or \"Generate a Derivative Image For Media Attachment\". This is where you configure which queue it goes to (which derivative-creating program runs), which field the resulting file ends up in, and potentially which additional arguments to pass to the microservice.</li> <li>Configure Contexts to trigger the Action to create derivatives.

Add a Derivative reaction and select the Action you created in the previous step.</li> <li>Configure your resource node to display its (potentially multiple) files as desired.

This allows us to interact with metadata (add, edit, remove, display, index in a search engine...) almost entirely using standard Drupal processes. If exporting this metadata to Fedora and/or a triplestore, the values are serialized to RDF using mappings that can be set for each bundle.</p>   <p>Drupal 8 Terminology</p> <p>In Drupal 8, Fields can be attached to bundles (sometimes called entity sub-types -- e.g. Content types, Media types, Vocabularies) or entities (e.g. Users). For more on Fields, see \"2.3 Content Entities and Fields\" and \"6.3 Adding Basic Fields to a Content Type\" in the Official Drupal Guide.</p>   <p>As described in the resource nodes section, Islandora digital objects are comprised of Drupal nodes for descriptive metadata, Drupal media for technical metadata, and Drupal files for the binary objects. This section describes how Islandora uses and extends Drupal fields to manage descriptive metadata.</p>","location":"user-documentation/metadata/"},{"title":"Content Types","text":"<p>In Drupal, Nodes come in different subtypes called Content Type. These let you define a type of content (\"Article\" and \"Basic Page\" are Drupal defaults and \"Repository Item\" is an Islandora specific example), the set of metadata fields that are attached to that content, and how those fields can be edited and displayed. Each Content Type is essentially a metadata profile that can be used for a piece of web content, or to describe a digital resource. You can create your own Content Types for your Islandora project or use a pre-defined one like Repository Item from the Islandora_defaults module. We will go over the metadata specific aspects of Content Types below, but for a fuller walk-through of creating a Content Type see here.</p> <p>Not all Content Types in your Drupal site need be Islandora Resource Nodes. Making a Content Type a Resource Node will associate Islandora specific behaviours (such as syncing to Fedora or causing derivatives to be generated) with it. The decision to make a content an Islandora resource node is left to the discretion of the site manager. In Islandora, a \"resource node\" is usually considered a descriptive record for \"a thing\", and is conceptually similar to an \"Islandora Object\" in 7.x, i.e. a \"Fedora Object\" in Fedora 3.x and below. Read more on configuring a Content Type to be treated as a Resource Node.</p>","location":"user-documentation/metadata/#content-types"},{"title":"Fields","text":"<p>The administrator will define the fields that are associated with a specific Content Type. The same fields can be applied to different Content Type, but the field display and editing configurations are unique to each Content Type. The names and definitions of these fields are specific to Drupal and do not have to correspond to an outside metadata schema. You will give each field a Label, Machine Name, and a specific Field Type, like Text, Integer, EDTF, or Entity Reference (see below). Specific to the Field Type you will then define the maximum length of the field, the number of values it can contain, and what taxonomies it might link to.</p> <p>Fields can be added under Administration &gt;&gt; Structure &gt;&gt; Content types &gt;&gt; Your Content Type's Name &gt;&gt; Manage fields (/admin/structure/types/your_type/fields). This tab will list all Fields, their Label, Machine Name, Field Type, and give you the option to make what edits to the definition of that field that you can.</p> <p>Certain decisions must be made when fields are created, and before any content is added, because they can not be changed later. Field Type can not be changed, so you wouldn't be able to change a text field to a taxonomy field after creation. The field's machine name also can't be changed. The number of values allowed in a field or its maximum length or type of item to reference (in the case of Entity reference fields) can not be changed after content has been added. You can, however, always add new fields to a Content Type, even after content has been added.</p>  <p>7.x Migration Note: What About My MODS XML?</p> <p>Even when using islandora_defaults there is no \"official\" metadata schema in Islandora. Where Islandora 7.x used MODS, and took advantage of its hierarchical/extensible structure, Drupal Fields are a flat structure working with distinct, individual elements. You can base your fields on those in MODS, or any other schema, but that structure is up to you. The Metadata Interest Group has developed a sample MODS-Drupal-RDF mapping, which provides a structure upon which you can build your Drupal fields. It is used by the Repository Item Content Type in islandora_defaults.</p>   <p>You Cannot Change The Content Type Of A Node</p> <p>Once a node is created, its Content Type cannot be changed. Just as you are unable to change many aspects of a Field once it has been created, once a node has been created it is now permanently of that Content Type and the fields associated with it. At that point your only option would be to create a new node of the intended content type, map the field values (programmatically or by copy-paste), and update any media or children that refer to the old node to refer to the new one.</p>  <p>The islandora_defaults module provides a Repository Item Content Type that can be used as a structure to build your collection around, or it can be used as a sample to see how fields in Content Type work.

If your content requires longer titles we recommend you create a separate \"long_title\" field to store the full title and reserve the default title field for a display title. There is a contributed module called Node Title Length, which allows an administrator to configure the length of the title field in the core node table.

Whereas instances of content types are called nodes, items in a vocabulary are called taxonomy terms (or simply terms). Traditionally, taxonomy terms are used to classify content in Drupal. For instance, the Article Content Type includes a field <code>field_tags</code> that can refer to terms in the Tags vocabulary.</p> <p>There are two ways that users can interact with taxonomies: they can be \"closed,\" e.g. a fixed list to pick from in a dropdown, or \"open,\" e.g. <code>field_tags</code> where users can enter new terms, which are created on the fly. This is not set on the vocabulary itself, but in the configuration of the field (typically on a node). Terms within vocabularies have an ordering, and can have hierarchical structure, but do not need to.</p> <p>Islandora (through the Islandora Core Feature) creates the 'Islandora Models' vocabulary which includes the terms 'Audio', 'Binary', 'Collection', 'Compound Object', 'Digital Document', 'Image', 'Newspaper', 'Page', 'Paged Content', 'Publication Issue', and 'Video'. Islandora Defaults provides contexts that cause certain actions (e.g. derivatives to happen, or blocks to appear) based on which term is used.</p>   <p>The Controlled Access Terms module provides additional vocabularies:</p> <ul> <li>Corporate Body</li> <li>Country</li> <li>Family</li> <li>Form</li> <li>Genre</li> <li>Geographic Location</li> <li>Language</li> <li>Person</li> <li>Resource Types</li> <li>Subject</li> </ul> <p>Each of these vocabularies has its own set of fields allowing repositories to further describe them. The Repository Item Content Type has fields that can reference terms in these vocabularies.

In Legacy, Fedora stored all properties and content associated with an object - not only its owner, dc.title, status, PID, and status - but also any content files such as OBJ, DC, MODS, and RELS-EXT. In Islandora Legacy, Fedora acted as the authoritative, primary source for all aspects of an object. Fedora 3.x was not an optional component of an Islandora Legacy repository, instead it served as the primary datastore.</p> <p>In Islandora, using Fedora is optional. That's right, optional. Drupal, and not Fedora, is the primary source of all aspects of an Islandora object, and, with some variations, Drupal, not Fedora, is the primary datastore in an Islandora repository. If Fedora is present in an Islandora repository, content in it is a tightly synchronized copy of object properties and files managed by Drupal.</p> <p>Even though Fedora is optional in Islandora, most repositories will use it since it provides its own set of services that are worth taking advantage of, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Flexible and configurable disk storage architecture</li> <li>Fixity digest generation</li> <li>Memento versioning</li> <li>Integration with RDF/Linked Data triple-stores</li> <li>Integration with Microservices via API-X</li> <li>WebAC Policies for access control (not currently leveraged by default)</li> </ul> <p>In Islandora repositories that use Fedora, all properties about Drupal nodes are mirrored in Fedora as RDF properties. But, even if an Islandora instance does not use Fedora, Drupal can provide an object's properties as RDF (again, Drupal is the primary source of data in Islandora). In addition, the Drupal media associated with Islandora objects are persisted to Fedora, although exactly which media is configurable within the Islandora admin interface. Just as Drupal out of the box has a public and private filesystem, Islandora adds a third filesystem to Drupal called, not surprisingly, \"fedora\", and it is to this filesystem that media are persisted.
