# Docker Demo

There are two demos of Islandora available to download and install. There is [an install profile demo available in Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/px0gxg3ik4hhypc/Islandora-Sandbox-Docker-Demo-2022.zip?dl=0) and [a starter-site based demo available in Google Drive, prepared for the March camp](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ebhxFLCbH1ZCKwQ5nNgwhf_IR4hVtUYi/view?usp=sharing). Both are loaded with the same sample content to demonstrate
features of Islandora and provide a starting point for exploration. The Islandora Foundation recommends using the starter-site based demo as the Foundation is intending to deprecate the install profile based demo, and use starter site at sandbox.islandora.ca. 

Download your preferred demo and use the instructions below to install.It is recommended that you have a minimum of 4GB of space available on your machine before getting started. It will take some time to build the image. Thanks, and happy building!

Requirements
==============================================================

Before you can set up your demonstration locally you must first install a few
software packages.

Docker Desktop
--------------------------------------------------------------

[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) provides a
graphical user interface for all major platforms.

<https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop>

Follow the link above, select the appropriate system, and follow the
installation instructions.

!!! Note
    For Windows 10, you may receive the "Docker Failed to Start" Error message. To resolve this:
    * Download WSL 2 from Step 4 in [these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package)--do not do any other steps in these instructions
    * Under Windows ‘Firewall & Network Protection’, ‘Allow an app through the firewall’, and ‘Change settings’ to select the ‘Private’ box for ‘Virtual Machine Monitoring’
    * Restart computer for all changes to take effect


!!! Note
    There is an open issue with macOS M1 chip users upgrading to Docker Desktop version v4.16.2. Currently it is suggested that you don’t upgrade to version v4.16.2 until the Islandora community finds a fix.
    For more details see the relevant issue: [https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/isle-dc/issues/323](https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/isle-dc/issues/323)


**If you already have Docker Desktop installed,** make sure that the **Extensions** 
feature is listed in the left sidebar. If it is not, you need to update to the newest 
version of Docker Desktop. This is required to add the Portainer extension.

Portainer Extension
--------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have worker [Docker Desktop](#dockerdesktop) installation, you can add
the [Portainer](https://portainer.io/) extension:

1. Open Docker Desktop.
2. From the Dashboard, select Add Extensions in the menu bar.
3. The Extensions Marketplace opens.
4. Browse the available extensions.
5. Select **Portainer**
6. Click Install.

For more information on Portainer refer to its
[documentation](https://docs.portainer.io/).

Setup
==============================================================

Assuming you have all the [Requirements](#requirements) installed
and running. You can now setup your demo. 

Get a Yaml file
--------------------------------------------------------------

For the newer starter-site based demo you only need to download the yaml file at the link above and skip to 'Create Stack' in the instructions below. For the older install-profile based demo you must Generate docker-compose.yml following the instructions below. 

Generate docker-compose.yml (install-profile based demo only)
--------------------------------------------------------------

In this package there are some platform specific scripts. Please **double
click** on the appropriate script for your platform:

| Platform  | Script        |
| :-------- | :------------ |
| Linux     | setup.command |
| Macintosh | setup.command |
| Windows   | setup.bat     |
[Table [states]: Platform specific setup script.]

This will install a local certificate and generate a `docker-compose.yml` file.
During execution of the script, you will be **prompted for your admin password**, 
in order to install the local certificate.

_**Note for Mac users:**_ If when executing the script, you are shown a pop-up warning
that "setup.command cannot be opened", please navigate to _System Preferences >
Security and Privacy_. Here, you can click "Allow anyway" and then re-try running
the script. This may need to be done more than once.

Create Stack
--------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have generated your yaml successfully or downloaded the pre-made yaml file, you can open **Portainer** via the Docker
Desktop Dashboard. 

1. Open Docker Desktop.
2. Click on Portainer.
3. If you see the Quick Setup Environment Wizard, click “Get Started" and select your local environment. Otherwise, select your local environment under "Environments".
4. Open the sidebar.
5. Click on **Stacks**.
6. Click **Add Stack**.
7. Type in the name **sandbox** (_lowercase_).
8. Select **Upload from your Computer**.
9. Upload the **docker-compose.yml** file you generated via the setup script.
10. Click on **Deploy the Stack**. The button will then display _Deployment in progress_  - do not click away while this message is shown.

This may take a **very long** time if this is the first time setting up
the demo as it must download all the Docker Images from the
internet. 


Wait for Install
--------------------------------------------------------------

Demo still needs to install and configure `Drupal`, which may
take upwards of _10-15 minutes_. You can check on the install process by doing
the following.

1. Open Docker Desktop.
2. Click on Portainer.
3. Open the sidebar.
4. Click on **Stacks**.
5. Click on **sandbox**.
6. Click on the Logs icon for **Drupal**.
7. Examine the log output waiting for the message below.

When completed you should see the following output at the end of the log.

```
